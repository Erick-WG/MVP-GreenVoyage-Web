## **MVP Green_Voyage**
## Problem
### Background
- The travel industry is the leading contributor to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. We aim to minimize the carbon footprints brought by travelers by controlling some aspects of how they commute, that is, fostering the adoption of greener commuting methods, from using electric and hybrid cars to other methods that help minimize the carbon footprint.
### The Problem
- Carbon emission.
- Control of how we choose to travel.
- Most of the Greenhouse emissions are a product of how we traditionally commute.
### Our Approach
- By providing a Trip planning site/ app, we give the Voyagers (Tourists) the opportunity to choose to save the planet with every small action taken toward a greener traveling experience, this goes by connecting our voyagers with others who have the same interest and also connecting them with trip guides (Trip planners are optional) who bring the practices to life.
### Goals & Success
- We aim to onboard as many Voyagers as possible in order to accelerate the growth and adoption of a future sustainable method of commute.
- Our success is evident in the rate of adoption of greener methods of commute by Voyagers, Our metrics are evident in the community built around Green_Voyage
## Solution
### Features
- We provide electric and hybrid car logistics for our solutions where Voyagers can choose how they commute.
